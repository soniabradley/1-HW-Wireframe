# HW-Wireframe
Hmk 1

For this week's assignment, students will either implement a basic portfolio in raw HTML or CSS, or put their new skills to the test by building a wireframe.

Tell sublime what kind of language to use

Open carrot and type html, to use html, for automatic fill

telling browser we are using html
inside is the head which includes meta data
insert title
then the link for css stylesheet

start with body
insert header
insert nav
insert main div with class=wrapper
insert section
insert article
insert another div with class=content

insert style.css class 

wrapper 
The "0" sets the top and bottom margin to "0" and the "auto" sets the right and left margin to "auto" which is what actually centers the content.

header
margin:10px 0px;
top and bottom margins are 10px
right and left margins are 0px

header, #nav, #footer
padding:20px 0px;
top and bottom padding are 20px
right and left padding are 0px

#left, #right {
padding: 15px 10px 10px 10px;
top padding is 15px
right padding is 10px
bottom padding is 10px
left padding is 10px

#left
Default value:	0

ul
margin: 0;
all four margins are 0;

i.e. .row
margin: 25px 50px 75px;
top margin is 25px
right and left margins are 50px
bottom margin is 75px

It has been possible for a long time to create a grid of boxes that fills the browser width and wraps nicely (when the browser is resized), by using the float property.

However, the inline-block value of the display property makes this even easier.

inline-block elements are like inline elements but they can have a width and a height.
